# max480's Helping Hand

Just a grab bag of Celeste code mods that were requested to me, and that could be useful for others as well.

Provides the following things:
- **Temple Eye tracking Madeline**: a temple eye that follows Madeline instead of Theo.
- **Camera Catchup Speed Trigger**: allows to set how fast the camera reaches its target. This is useful for _really_ fast sections, where growing offsets would be necessary otherwise.
